Add the following changes:

``` css
#lockDialogGroup 
{
  background: url(file:///usr/share/backgrounds/mybackground.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center; 
}
```
Change the file path of the background image to the background of your choice.
Save these changes, and restart your machine.
You should see notice the changes you made, once you hit the lock/login screen.

Viola, Done.
